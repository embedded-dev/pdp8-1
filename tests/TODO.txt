Add ifdef protection around all headers
    Generally appears to be recommended against.
    Can falsy mask out code if included in multiple namespaces.

default name and null parent for all components?

dual monitor/drivers/agents?

namespace with package?

name/parent defaults

check on precise timing for CPU driver/monitor (Use clock edge+1?)
Use standard constants for CPU opcodes/flags
Pass down interface/config between components in tree
sequence for file i/o for uart
move around tlm1/2 ports?
Make CPU pure Verilog-2001
  Drop enums into constants


Test that AND does not affect LINK bit, but does affect all AC bits.
Test TAD with both a low and high LINK bit and carry/no-carry will/will-not
complement LINK.

ISZ does not touch LINK/AC. It skips on result of increment being zero.

AND - Affects AC register. Reads Memory.
TAD - Affects AC and LINK registers. Reads Memory.
ISZ - Affects PC. Reads and Writes Memory.
DCA - Affects AC. Writes Memory.
JMS - Affects PC. Writes Memory.
JMP - Affects PC.

Indirect addressing of locations 0010 - 0017 (0x008 - 0x00f), indirect address
is incremented in memory for auto-index mode. Post-increment value is used in
the indirect look-up.

Test CIA or CMA+IAC for 2's complement negation.

zero bit means current page if set and zero page if un-set.

Test instruction page crossing.
Test instruction field crossing/wrap. (7777 -> 0000)
Test auto-index wrap.
Test ISZ wrap.

Test unconditional skips
